New BMI formula from Dr DIASOLUKA = INDICE DE DODUITÉ

ROUNDNESS INDEX .
	

The Body Mass Index (BMI or Quetelet Index ), is a tool used to assess a person's corpulence based on their height and weight.

Dr. DIASOLUKA's Body Mass Index is called ROUNDNESS INDEX .


Why use the term of ROUNDNESS (DODUITÉ) ?
Because this formula clearly reflects better the deviations of values from normal , especially in overweight, and the anomaly becomes all the more obvious the further away we move from normal values , as we will see later.


There are two main well-known formulas for calculating body mass index (BMI) :


/=====
//
BMI according to Adolphe QUETELET = [ Pds / T^ 2 ]

and its improved version by Trefethen

BMI according to Nick TREFETHEN = [ ( 1.3*weight[kg ] ) / (height[m]^2.5) ]
//
